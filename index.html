        Confusion never stops
        Closin' walls and tickin'clocks, gonna
        Come back and take you home
        I could not stop, that you now know, singin'
        Come out upon my seas
        Cursed missed opportunities, am I
        A part of the cure?
        Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

        You are
        You are
        You are
        You are

        You are
        You are

        And nothing else compares
        Oh, no, nothing else compares
        And nothing else compares

        You are
        You are

        Home, home, where I wanted to go
        Home, home, where I wanted to go
        Home, home, where I wanted to go
        Home, home, where I wanted to go
